# ``` npm i --save auth-setup ``` 
- ### A node file with prebuilt server functions for setting up [two-step-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/two-step-auth) locally for custom Mail ID's and server.

## Need for the package
  - As per the suggestions, people need the package to be available locally, and also have them easily set for hosting, 
  - **Privacy concerns** , Even though we never share any email ID's that was sent using the package [two-step-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/two-step-auth), and neither do we use it for our purposes, people wanted their own server so this was created on top of  that, You have control on your data.
    -  #### Own Mail ID
    -  #### Host on your favorite servers / Micro servers
    - #### Greater speeds of sending mails
